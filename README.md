Hi There 👋
I'm Ido, an Israeli queer game developer and designer. 
Most of my experience is developing video games with Unity engine, but I do like an occasional change of pace trying out some other engine at a gamejam or hobby project.
When not confined by Unity's C#, Python is my favorite and my go to language of choice.
